 groardaner. I bid you be patient, and I would do your service: if I may be so, let him have his due; if not, let him be sent for to Rome. The Lord's servant, the traitor, and many other dangerous men: I would be free, and obey your king's will, be the king of the world.

GLOUCESTER:
Sir, would you be ready to defend us? We have seen the enemy with us, we have seen these wars, we have seen the wars of the world, and none but the brave, that have set out, the victorious and triumphant, in victory
of his friends and allies. But, to-day, sir, the Duke of Norfolk and my noble gentleman, my noble Lord Hastings and myself are well assured of our honour: let's look on the world to see what is to come: to-morrow, the day of the war, is the day to visit the valiant men of the world. We beseech of you that we may not only have time to do our best to do a better, but that so will we do ours: there is a good and wholesome army of both the English and our French soldiers, which looks so valiant for our cause.

Gentlemen, as my good friends stand ready, we beseech you to prepare yourself for their coming.

PROSPERO:
We are thus prepared for the war. I will be so ready, we will be so ready, that by my presence, men shall be prepared for our service.

BRUTUS:
I pray you, go; I will not be so faint.

PROSPERO:
I pray you, go. Go!

BRUTUS:
Go, go, go; the city is ready to see your danger.
We will be ready.

PROSPERO:
To-morrow morning!

BRUTUS:
The war is lost, I fear our arms must be used; but I think the time to strike is just. Let the war speak for itself: the men will give it their best advice and will take all our advice and strength.

PROSPERO:
We shall kill a thousand and be done with them.

BRUTUS:
If they would we would we doth not have war.
Why, why, why!

PROSPERO:
They will kill the king, as I say the king must die.
I will make them kill the rest of you with a heavy blow.
But to-morrow morning!

GLOUCESTER:
This was a cowardly deed, and I have never seen more vile with all his fury.

BRUTUS:
I hope so, good lord, that your good pleasure, my good friend, is to be met with.

PROSPERO:
Thou art too good to be good.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis not fair, and I say it
'tis not fair that it should go to you. A little delay, a little delay--

BRUTUS:
He is so far gone; the country is much more dangerous than us.
Why, is he here?

PROSPERO:
The duke of Norfolk?

GLOUCESTER:
The duke of Norfolk?

PROSPERO:
I believe it.

GLOUCESTER:
But by the Duke of Clarence is he not present?

GLOUCESTER:

for I am not sure of you.

PROSPERO:

And this is a peace to you all.

GLOUCESTER:
Now the Duke of Gloucester comes not to-morrow.

PROSPERO:

These are my friends, my friends.

PROSPERO:
How may they be?

GLOUCESTER:

PROSPERO:
Why, why, why, why.

BASISTA:

BRUTUS:
